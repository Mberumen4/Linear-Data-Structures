*1. When would you use a linked list and why?
You’d use a linked list when you need to add or remove stuff from the middle of a list without messing with the whole thing. It’s good when your list changes a lot because it’s faster for that than arrays.

2. What’s the difference between a stack and a queue?
A stack is like a stack of plates — the last one you put on is the first one you take off. A queue is like a line at school — the first one in is the first one out.

3. When would a developer use a stack?
Stacks are useful when you want to go backwards, like undoing something, or when solving problems like checking if parentheses match in math or code.

4. When would a developer use an array instead of a list?
You’d use an array when you already know how many items you’ll have, and you want fast access to them using their position (like the 3rd item, 5th item, etc.). Arrays are a bit faster and use less memory too.
