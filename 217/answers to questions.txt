Part 1 Abstraction:

Describe the difference between a virtual method and an abstract method. 
Virtual method- A base class method that can be overridden by derived classes, with a default implementation.
Abstract method- A method without an implementation in the base class; derived classes must implement it.


Explain why a developer would use abstraction.
Abstraction simplifies code by hiding complex details. 
It lets you use objects at a high level, like calling `CalculateArea()` without needing to know how each shape works.


Part 2 Encapsulation:

List two reasons why a developer would use accessors (getters and setters).

1.Control Over Data- Ensures fields are modified correctly.

2.Encapsulation:-Hides the inner details of an object while still allowing access to its data.



Describe the difference between a private and protected attribute.

Private- The attribute can only be accessed within the class itâ€™s defined.

Protected- The attribute can be accessed within the class and by subclasses.
